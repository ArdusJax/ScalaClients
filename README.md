This is a project that I hope will help me get familiar with Scala. I'm a Java/C# programmer that is learning Scala. 
Please feel free to give me advice and help me along in my journey.

I have based this project on the play framework.

#### Clients
* Artifactory - Restful Client for Artifactory 
* Github - Restful Client for GitHub

#### Requirements
* Intellij IDE (Not really a requirement, but it rocks and makes things easier. :) )
* Play Framework 2.4
* Scala 2.11.7
* Typesafe activator 1.3.7 (This is included when you download Play Framework)

#### Setup
After cloning the project please run activator clean, and then, if you're using Intellij IDE, import the project using the sbt option.
